This repo contains code which we used for developing our chatbot . 

We used api.ai as our platform  

The way a user interacts with our bot is through SMS

***Bot Idea*** - Develop a mobile commerce bot with SMS being the primary mode of interaction. This device targeted at users who have limited or no access to Internet   

Our bot in it's current setup helps to order a mobile but we plan to scale it up for further products and services

You can give our bot a spin by 

1. Go to https://bot.api.ai/c674cbe7-3a11-4fed-83b6-db95fbfd401c and play along

2. Message +1(424)-216-5553 - Might have issues getting replies , as this number was purchased on a trial plan with limited number of replies
